# What is Grafing?

A graphing calculator... The best way I can explain. You can use it to plot points and functions. Plus inbuilt Linear Regression and Polygonal Regression algorithms are the icing on the top. My initial plan was to build a mathematical engine that can perform different types of mathematical operations and does not require much of a lower-level implementation. But somehow I ended up with making a graphing tool.
